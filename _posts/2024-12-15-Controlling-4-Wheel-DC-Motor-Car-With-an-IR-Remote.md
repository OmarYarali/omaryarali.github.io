## Introduction  

This project focuses on using an IR remote to control both a DC motor and an RGB LED, showcasing how versatile and practical IR technology can be. The DC motor is equipped with functionality for adjusting its speed and direction, allowing for precise control over its operation. Simultaneously, the RGB LED can display six distinct colors, along with an off state, and its brightness can be fine-tuned to match desired intensity levels.

Additionally, I explore how the DC motor's functionality—such as adjusting its speed and reversing its direction—can be seamlessly managed using the same IR remote. This project serves as a great example of combining creativity with technology to build a versatile and interactive system for various applications.

## What is Infrared Light?  

### What is Light?  

Photos are taken from Teledyne FLIR and  LYNRED.  

Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that exhibits wave-particle duality, meaning it can behave both as a wave and as a particle (photon). It is characterized primarily by its wavelength and frequency. The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into different segments or bands, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.   

![](assets/infrared-waves-definition-uses-examples_01001114_133518.jpg)  

*Visible light*, also known as white light, ranges in wavelength from 0.4 to 0.8 micrometers (µm). It is mainly emitted by the sun and can be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted by objects. When white light strikes an object, some wavelengths are absorbed, while others are reflected. The reflected wavelengths determine the color we perceive.  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-17 115237.png)  

*Infrared Radiation* has wavelengths ranging from 0.8 to 50 micrometers (µm), making it invisible to the human eye. Some animals, such as snakes, can detect infrared radiation, which corresponds to the thermal energy emitted by objects. Any object with a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273°C) emits infrared radiation, both during the day and at night.  

### Infrared Radiation and Temperature  

When objects heat up, their radiation changes in two significant ways:  

*Increased Emission Across All Wavelengths*  
 As an object becomes hotter, the object emits more radiation across all wavelengths. This makes the object appear brighter overall.    

*Shift in Peak Emission*  
The second thing that happens is that the peak of the emission shifts from the red all the way up through the blue. It goes on even further, the peak emission can shift beyond visible light into the ultraviolet region.  


### Wien's Displacement Law  
Wien's Displacement Law describes the relationship between the temperature of a black body and the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation. This law is essential for understanding the thermal emission of objects. Wien's Displacement Law is expressed as:  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-18 200054.png)  
                                                                      
Where:  
**λmax** is the wavelength of maximum emission (in meters).  
**𝑇** is the absolute temperature of the black body (in Kelvin, K).  
**𝑏** is Wien's constant, approximately 2.897×10^−3 mK.   

**Note**  
*λmax* is the wavelength where the intensity of radiation is the highest, but the object still emits radiation at other wavelengths.  

As the temperature of an object increases, the wavelength at which it emits the most energy decreases (i.e., shifts toward shorter wavelengths like visible or ultraviolet light). Conversely, cooler objects emit most of their radiation at longer wavelengths (infrared or microwave regions).  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-17 182540.png)

### Bonus Information: Explanation of Why sunlight is white?  
The Sun's surface temperature is about 5800 Kelvin (K). By using Wien's constant, the peak wavelength of sunlight from formula is approximately 502 nm. This corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum. So from Physics perspective, the Sun must appear green right? Before questioning Physics, let me finish my explanation.  

**Why the Sun Doesn't Appear Green**  
This is more to do with Biology than Physics. Even though the Sun’s radiation peaks in the green region, it emits a broad spectrum of light that includes significant amounts of red, blue, and other colors. Our eyes have three types of cone cells sensitive to red, green, and blue light. Our eyes have not evolved to distinguish colour of highest intensity from colours of lower intensity, therefore the brain interprets the combination of all these wavelengths as white light.  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-18 200803.png)  

The physics of blackbody radiation and Wien's Law are accurate, but the perception of color is influenced by biology (human vision) and how our brain processes light from the entire spectrum.  

The higher the temperature of a body, the closer its emitted radiation is to the visible light spectrum. Also, when a blacksmith heats a piece of iron until it is "white-hot," it emits radiation across all visible wavelengths, making it appear white.  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-17 120043.png)  


### Rayleigh-Jeans law  
The Rayleigh-Jeans Law is a formula that describes the spectral radiance of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody at a given temperature T. It is an approximation that applies at long wavelengths (or low frequencies) and is derived based on classical physics.  

![](assets/image.png)  

Where:  
**Bλ(T)** is the spectral radiance (power emitted per unit area per unit wavelength).  
**c** is the speed of light (≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s).  
**kB** is Boltzmann's constant (≈ 1.38 × 10^−23 J/K).  
**T** is the absolute temperature of the blackbody in Kelvin.  
**λ** is the wavelength.  

The Rayleigh-Jeans Law accurately predicts the behavior of blackbody radiation at long wavelengths (low frequencies). When it comes to short wavelengths (high frequencies), the law predicts an infinite amount of energy, which contradicts experimental results. This discrepancy, known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe," was one of the critical failures of classical physics and led to the development of quantum mechanics.  


### Ultraviolet Catastrophe  
The ultraviolet catastrophe refers to a major problem in classical physics when predicting the radiation emitted by a blackbody at different wavelengths. This issue was particularly evident in the 19th century, and its resolution led to significant advancements in the field of quantum physics. The problem with the Rayleigh-Jeans Law was resolved by Max Planck, who introduced Planck's Law of blackbody radiation in 1900. Planck's Law accurately describes the spectral radiance across all wavelengths.  

![](assets/ultraviolet-catastrophe.jpg)  

**What Was the Problem?**  
Classical physics, particularly the Rayleigh-Jeans law, treated energy as continuous. According to classical theory, a blackbody could emit radiation at any frequency, and the energy emitted at a given frequency was not restricted. This led to the prediction that as the wavelength of radiation decreases (moving towards the ultraviolet region), the intensity would increase without bound—this is the ultraviolet catastrophe.  

From Rayleigh-Jeans Law, as *λ* approaches 0 (shorter wavelengths), the intensity approaches infinity, which clearly contradicted experiments.      

**Solution by Planck**  
Planck realized that this continuous energy assumption was not correct. He proposed that energy was not emitted continuously, but rather in discrete packets, which he called quanta. Each quantum of energy was proportional to the frequency of the radiation:  

![](assets/0_xN008-8vedYoNJAs.jpg)  

This assumption led to the idea that energy levels in a system could only take certain discrete values, rather than any value.  


### Planck's Law  

Using the concept of quantized energy, Planck derived a new formula for the spectral radiance of blackbody radiation, which replaced the Rayleigh-Jeans law. Planck's Law describes the spectral distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body at a given temperature. It provides a formula for calculating the spectral radiance, or the intensity of electromagnetic radiation at a specific wavelength and temperature. This law resolved the “ultraviolet catastrophe” predicted by classical physics, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-17 201747.png)  

**B(λ, T)** = Spectral radiance (W·sr⁻¹·m⁻³)  
**h** = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^−34 J·s)  
**c** = Speed of light (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)  
**λ** = Wavelength of radiation (m)  
**kB** = Boltzmann's constant (1.381 × 10^−23 J/K)  
**T** = Absolute temperature (K)  

From Planck's Law, we can see that:  

*Wavelength Dependence*  
 The amount of radiation emitted depends on the wavelength (λ).  

*Temperature Influence*  
As the temperature (T) increases, the peak of the emission curve shifts to shorter wavelengths (described by Wien's Displacement Law).  

*Quantum Nature*  
The exponential term reflects the quantized nature of radiation, which was a breakthrough in explaining how energy is emitted in discrete packets (quanta).  

*At high frequencies (short wavelengths),* the exponential factor dominates, which causes the intensity to decrease exponentially. This prevented the intensity from diverging, as classical theory had predicted. Instead of the radiation intensity growing infinitely at small wavelengths (the ultraviolet catastrophe), Planck's formula predicted a smooth decrease in intensity.  
*At low frequencies (long wavelengths)*, Planck's law approximates the Rayleigh-Jeans law, meaning it agrees with classical predictions for lower energy levels (where the temperature is not very high). This matched experimental data well for longer wavelengths.

Infrared cameras and thermal imaging devices rely on Planck's law to measure temperature.  


### Stefan-Boltzmann's Law  
Stefan-Boltzmann's Law describes the power radiated by a black body in terms of its temperature. It states that the total energy emitted per unit surface area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.  

![](assets/336003550.gif)  
                                                                
For real materials (which are not perfect black bodies), we also multiply with emissivity of the material.   

ϵ = Emissivity of the material (0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1).  
A perfect black body has an emissivity 𝜖 = 1, while a perfect reflector has 𝜖 = 0.  

Higher temperatures lead to exponentially higher radiation due to the T^4 relationship. As an object's temperature increases, it radiates more energy, and this radiation spans a range of wavelengths, including visible light. At higher temperatures, a greater proportion of the emitted radiation falls within the visible spectrum (Wien's Displacement Law). This is why:  

Hotter objects (like stars) appear brighter and often shift towards bluish-white colors.  
Cooler objects emit less radiation and may glow red or not emit visible light at all.  

                                            
### Kirchhoff's Law of Thermal Radiation  
The law states that for any object at thermal equilibrium (balance), the emissivity of a surface is equal to its absorptivity. In simple terms,  
**"A good absorber is also a good emitter at the same wavelength and temperature."**  

*Emissivity (ε):* As l explained, the fraction of radiation emitted by the surface compared to a perfect black body at the same temperature.  
*Absorptivity (α):* The fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the surface.  

At thermal equilibrium:
                                                                    **𝜀 = 𝛼**  

Perfect black body: Has an emissivity and absorptivity of 1 (ε = α = 1).  
Reflective surfaces: Poor absorbers, so they are also poor emitters.  A dark surface absorbs more radiation (high absorptivity) and thus emits more radiation at the same temperature. (Black Body in this context).

### The Concept of a Black Body

**Black Bodies and Emissivity**  
A black body is a theoretical object that absorbs all incident wavelengths and emits radiation solely based on its temperature. The efficiency with which real objects emit radiation is expressed by their emissivity, a value ranging from 0 to 1. Emissivity compares the radiance of a body to that of a black body.  

An emissivity of 1 means the body emits radiation as efficiently as a black body.
An emissivity of 0.5 means the body emits half the radiation of a black body.  

*Emissivity* depends on an object's physical properties. For example:  
Human skin has a high emissivity of around 0.98.  
Polished metals, like aluminum, can have emissivity values below 0.1, making them effective infrared reflectors (infrared mirrors).   

Knowing an object's emissivity allows for the accurate calibration of infrared devices, enabling precise temperature measurement.  

**How a Black Body Works**  
*Absorption*  
A black body absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that strikes it, regardless of wavelength. This means it does not reflect or transmit any light—hence the term "black body".  

*Emission*  
According to its temperature, a black body emits thermal radiation across a range of wavelengths. This emission follows Planck's Law, which describes how the intensity and distribution of emitted radiation depend on temperature.  

*Thermal Radiation*  
Thermal radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by any object with a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15°C). A black body emits the maximum possible radiation at every wavelength for its temperature.  

*Planck's Law:* Describes the spectral distribution of radiation emitted by a black body at a given temperature.  
*Wien's Displacement Law:* States that the wavelength at which a black body emits the most radiation shifts as its temperature changes. Higher temperatures shift the peak emission toward shorter wavelengths (e.g., visible light).  
Stefan-Boltzmann Law: Indicates that the total power radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature.  

### Bonus Information: Why are objects with emissivity near that of a black body more luminous?  

When emissivity ϵ ≈ 1, it means the object is efficient emitter of radiation, this can be explained through Stefan-Boltzmann's Law and the concept of emissivity. If an object has an emissivity near 1 (like a black body), it radiates more power compared to objects with lower emissivity at the same temperature. For instance, stars are excellent approximations of black bodies because they absorb and emit radiation extremely efficiently across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Their high temperature (ranging from thousands to millions of Kelvin) means they radiate a huge amount of power according to Stefan-Boltzmann's Law. Their emissivity is very close to 1 because they don't reflect much radiation — almost all the energy is emitted as light and other forms of radiation. Higher temperature results in exponentially higher radiation (T - P relationship). This combination of high temperature and high emissivity makes objects like stars incredibly luminous (they emit vast amounts of light).

### Discovery of Infrared Radiation  

Up until 1800, visible light was the only known part of the electromagnetic spectrum that's when astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered a whole new world of infrared radiation. This discovery marked a significant milestone in understanding the electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light.  

**Using a Prism to Split Sunlight**  
Herschel passed sunlight through a glass prism, which split the white light into its constituent colors (a spectrum of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). In his observations of sunlight, Herschel experimented with colors of light and noticed each one passed a different amount of heat.  

**Measuring Heat in Different Colors**  
To measure the heat associated with each color of light, he used thermometers with blackened bulbs. The blackened bulbs helped absorb more heat for accurate temperature readings.  

![](assets/IR Experiment.png)  

**Observation of Red Light**  
Herschel noted that the temperature increased as he moved the thermometer from blue to red. The temperature reading was highest in the red part of the spectrum.  

**Beyond Red Light**  
Out of curiosity, Herschel extended his thermometer just beyond the red part of the spectrum where no visible light was present. To his surprise, the thermometer showed a temperature even higher than in the visible red light region.  

Herschel concluded that there must be an invisible form of radiation beyond red light, which was responsible for the increased heat. He named this new discovery *“infrared radiation”*, from the Latin words:  

“Infra” = below  
“Red” = refers to its position below red in the visible spectrum.  

This experiment revealed that the electromagnetic spectrum extends beyond visible light, laying the foundation for understanding other types of electromagnetic waves such as ultraviolet (UV), X-rays, and radio waves. This breakthrough paved the way for future discoveries in the electromagnetic spectrum, leading to innovations in communication, astronomy, and medicine. Infrared radiation is now used in various fields like night vision, thermal imaging, remote sensing, and medical diagnostics.  


When I first learned about Wien's displacement law, I was fascinated to discover that the Sun's peak wavelength is in the green spectrum of visible light. However, then I came across an experiment that left me puzzled— How infrared radiation feel hotter than green light? How can this be? If the Sun's peak wavelength is in the visible spectrum (around green), in addition, green light has more energy than infrared because it has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency. Then, why does infrared radiation feel hotter to us than visible light?  

Before reading this, have you ever thought about this contradiction? It's one of those moments where science makes us stop and think deeper about what’s really happening. Let’s explore this intriguing question together.  

### Why Infrared Feels Hotter Even Though Green Is the Peak Wavelength?  

To understand this, we need to investigate several aspects of sunlight.  

**1. Wavelength and Heat Emission**  
As we explained, according to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by an object depends on its temperature. The Sun has a surface temperature of around 5,500°C (5,800 K), which places its peak wavelength in the visible light range, more specifically in green light. However, the Sun emits radiation across a broad spectrum, not just at the peak wavelength. While the peak of the Sun's radiation is in the visible spectrum, it emits far more energy overall in the infrared spectrum. The total intensity of radiation emitted by the Sun spans from infrared to ultraviolet, with infrared radiation covering a much larger range of wavelengths than visible light. So, while the peak is in the visible range, the total emitted energy in the infrared is greater because of the larger range of wavelengths in the infrared (0.7 µm to 1 mm) and the nature of thermal energy. As it travels through space and reaches Earth, infrared radiation is primarily responsible for warming us up, even though it's invisible to the naked eye.  

**2. How They Relate But Don't Contradict**  
Herschel’s discovery of infrared radiation was about the heat carried by light. He found that infrared radiation (beyond red) carries more thermal energy than visible light because the Sun emits a lot of energy in the infrared.  

On the other hand, Black body radiation refers to the color of emitted light, which shifts from red to blue as the temperature of the object increases. Blue light corresponds to a hotter temperature, but it does not necessarily mean it carries more heat in the way infrared does. In the context of glowing objects or black body radiation, for instance, blue light corresponds to higher temperatures than red light. However, Herschel's experiment dealt with solar radiation at Earth's surface, where the sun’s emission spectrum delivers more heat energy in the red and infrared range.  Blue light is emitted by hotter objects, meaning it comes from objects with higher temperatures (like blue stars), but it doesn't carry heat as effectively as infrared. Infrared radiation (even though it corresponds to lower-energy photons) is more abundant in the Sun's radiation and is much better at carrying heat to Earth.  

**3. Why Infrared Transfers Heat Better**  
Infrared radiation is effective at transferring heat because it interacts efficiently with molecules in the Earth's atmosphere and on surfaces. When infrared radiation strikes an object, its energy is absorbed and converted to heat. Even though visible light and ultraviolet light carry more energy per photon (especially the blue and UV parts), they don't transfer heat as effectively because they interact differently with materials (e.g., UV tends to cause chemical changes rather than heat).  

## IR Remote  

An IR (infrared) remote control works by sending coded infrared light signals to control electronic devices such as TVs, air conditioners, and audio systems.  

**Key Components of an IR Remote**  

*IR LED (Infrared Light-Emitting Diode):* Emits infrared light signals.  
*Microcontroller:* Generates the signal patterns for specific commands (like changing channels).  
*Buttons:* When pressed, they send input to the microcontroller.  
*Power Source:* Usually batteries.  

### How It Works  

**Signal Generation**  
Each button press corresponds to a specific binary code or signal pattern (e.g., turning the TV off or changing the volume). The microcontroller generates these codes.  

**Modulation**  
The signal is modulated with a carrier frequency, typically 38 kHz, to avoid interference from ambient infrared sources (like sunlight or indoor lighting).  

**Transmission**  
The IR LED emits the modulated infrared signal in pulses that represent the command code.  

**Reception**  
The receiving device has an IR sensor that detects the modulated IR light. The sensor demodulates the signal and sends the decoded command to the device's processor.  

**Execution**  
The device responds by executing the corresponding action, such as turning on, changing the channel, or adjusting the volume.  

**Technical Details**  
*Range:* Typically 5-10 meters; requires a direct line of sight.    
*IR Wavelength:* Around 940 nm (not visible to the human eye).  
*Encoding Schemes:* Popular protocols include NEC, Sony SIRC, and RC-5, each with its own signal format.  
Each protocol defines how data is structured, including headers, bit lengths, and commands.  

![](assets/photo_5413631656578902083_w.jpg)  


### Structure of an IR Command

An IR command typically has at least one of the following components:  

**Header**  
A unique signal pattern at the beginning to indicate the start of a command.  

**Address**  
Specifies the target device (e.g., a specific TV model or brand).  

**Command Code**  
The specific function (e.g., power on, volume up, channel change).  

**Checksum or Repeat Code (Optional)**  
Ensures data integrity or indicates a repeated command when the button is held down.  

**Common Applications of IR Commands**  
TV Remote Controls: Power, volume, and channel changes.  
Home Automation: Controlling lights, fans, or appliances.  
Robotics: Controlling robot movements with a remote.  
Custom Electronics Projects: IR-based communication between devices.  


## IR Communication Protocol  

The NEC (Nippon Electric Company) protocol is a popular infrared (IR) communication protocol commonly used for remote controls in consumer electronics like TVs, audio systems, and other appliances. It is designed to transmit commands via IR signals in a structured and reliable format.  

### Key Features of the NEC Protocol  

**Carrier Frequency**  
The IR signal is modulated at a carrier frequency of 38 kHz, which helps the receiver differentiate between the transmitted signal and ambient IR noise.  

**Data Format**  
The protocol transmits data in a series of pulses and spaces, representing binary "1" and "0".  

**Frame Structure**  
An NEC protocol message consists of four key components:  

*Leader Code:* A long pulse (9 ms) followed by a long space (4.5 ms). This signals the start of a transmission.  

**Data Bits**  
The actual command data, typically 32 bits divided into four 8-bit segments:  
*Address (8 bits):* Identifies the device to be controlled.  
*Address Inverted (8 bits):* Inverted bits of the address for error checking.  
*Command (8 bits):* Specifies the action or function (e.g., volume up, channel change).  
*Command Inverted (8 bits):* Inverted bits of the command for error checking.  
*Stop Bit:* A short pulse (560 µs) after the data, indicating the end of the transmission.  

![](assets/Screenshot 2024-12-14 221235.png)  

### Why Protocol use Inverted Addresses?  

The inverted address in an IR remote protocol, such as the NEC protocol, is a way to ensure data integrity and detect errors.  

**What is the Inverted Address?**  
The inverted address is the bitwise complement of the address.  
This means every bit in the inverted address is the opposite of the corresponding bit in the address:  
If a bit in the address is 1, the same bit in the inverted address is 0.  
If a bit in the address is 0, the same bit in the inverted address is 1.  

**Example**  
Address: 0b11001100  
Inverted Address: 0b00110011 (each bit is flipped)  

**Why Use an Inverted Address?**  
*Error Detection*  
The inverted address helps verify that the data was received correctly. If the address and its inversion don't match, an error likely occurred during transmission.  

*Data Integrity*  
By sending both the original and inverted values, the receiving system can confirm the accuracy of the received signal.  


## How to Check Inverted Address in Code?  

When decoding an NEC IR signal in Arduino:  
```c  
if (IR.decode()) {
  unsigned long rawData = IR.decodedIRData.decodedRawData;
  uint8_t address = rawData >> 24;  // Extract the first 8 bits (Address)
  uint8_t invertedAddress = (rawData >> 16) & 0xFF;  // Extract the next 8 bits (Inverted Address)

  if (address == (invertedAddress ^ 0xFF)) {
    Serial.println("Address and Inverted Address match!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Error: Address mismatch.");
  }

  IR.resume();
}
```  

### Code Explanation  

```c
if (IR.decode()) {
```  
This checks if an IR signal has been received and successfully decoded. If IR.decode() returns true, the IR data is available for processing.  

```c
unsigned long rawData = IR.decodedIRData.decodedRawData;
```  
rawData stores the entire 32-bit value received from the IR remote. As we explained, this 32-bit data typically contains:  
Address (8 bits)  
Inverted Address (8 bits)  
Command (8 bits)  
Inverted Command (8 bits)  

**Right Shift(>>) Operator**  
Right Shift(>>) is a binary operator that takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift.  

![](assets/rightshift.png)  

```c
uint8_t address = rawData >> 24;
```  

**Extract the First 8 Bits**  
The right shift operation (>> 24) moves the bits of rawData 24 positions to the right, effectively discarding the lower 24 bits. The result of the shift keeps only the highest (first) 8 bits of the original 32-bit value. Since address is declared as uint8_t (an 8-bit data type), it will only store those 8 bits.  

**Example**  
Suppose rawData is:  
```yaml
0xE619FF00
```  

In binary it is:  
```yaml
1110 0110 0001 1001 1111 1111 0000 0000
```   

When you do rawData >> 24:  
```yaml
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1110 0110
```  

Now, storing it in uint8_t address:  
```yaml
address = 0xE6  // The highest 8 bits of rawData   
```  


**Bitwise Operators**  
The & (bitwise AND) in C takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
The | (bitwise OR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.  
The ^ (bitwise XOR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

```c
uint8_t invertedAddress = (rawData >> 16) & 0xFF;
```  
Right shift by 16 bits (>> 16) moves the next 8 bits (the inverted address) to the least significant position.  
Masking with 0xFF (& 0xFF) ensures that only the lower 8 bits are kept, discarding any higher bits.

### Explanation of Masking  
Let's assume rawData is:  
```yaml
rawData = 0xE619FF00
```  

In binary, it looks like this:  
```yaml
  1110 0110     0001 1001        1111 1111       0000 0000
| Address  | Inverted Address |  Command   |  Inverted Command |
    0xE6          0x19              0xFF              0x00
```  
When we shift rawData right by 16 bits (>> 16), we get:  
```yaml
1110 0110 0001 1001 1111 1111 0000 0000  (original rawData)
↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ↓↓↓↓  (shift right by 16)
0000 0000 0000 0000 1110 0110 0001 1001
```  
Now, the inverted address (0001 1001) is in the least significant byte.  

**Masking with 0xFF**  
```yaml
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111 // (0XFF)
```
When we perform the bitwise AND (&) with 0xFF, we keep only the least significant byte:  

```yaml
  0000 0000 0000 0000 1110 0110 0001 1001  (after right shift)
& 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111  (mask with 0xFF)
-----------------------------------------
  0001 1001                              → 0x19
```  
*invertedAddress* now contains 0x19 (the second byte of the original rawData).  


```c
 if (address == (invertedAddress ^ 0xFF)) {
```  

**Check Address and Inverted Address**  
*invertedAddress ^ 0xFF* flips all the bits of invertedAddress (bitwise XOR with 0xFF). When *invertedAddress* all bits are flipped, if the transmission was successful, it should be equal to *address*.  This checks if the address and invertedAddress are correct inverses of each other. If they match, the data is likely valid.  

If the address and inverted address match, a confirmation message is printed. An error message is printed if there's a mismatch.  

```c
IR.resume();
```  
Prepares the IR receiver to handle the next signal.  

**Summary of this code**  
Receives an IR signal and decodes it. Extracts the address and inverted address from the rawData. Checks if the address and inverted address are valid by confirming they are inverses of each other. Prints a message based on whether the check passes or fails. Resumes listening for the next IR signal.  
This is a common way to ensure data integrity when dealing with IR signals using the NEC protocol or similar protocols that use address verification.  


### Pulse Distance Encoding  

The NEC protocol uses Pulse Distance Encoding to represent binary 0s and 1s. The pulses are always 562.5 µs long, but the spaces (gaps) that follow them differ for 0 and 1.

**Start Bit**  
A 9 ms pulse followed by a 4.5 ms space.  

Data Bits:
Each bit is sent as a 562.5 µs pulse followed by a space:
0: 562.5 µs space.
1: 1.6875 ms space.
Stop:
After all bits are sent, a final 562.5 µs pulse.
