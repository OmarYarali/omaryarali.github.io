## Introduction

In this post, we’ll dive into building a simple calculator using Arduino and an LCD display. You’ll learn how to set up the hardware, write the code, and handle user inputs for basic calculations.


## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a basic calculator using an Arduino and a 16x2 LCD display.   It supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator takes input via the Serial Monitor, processes the arithmetic operation, and displays the result on the LCD. Additionally, it gracefully handles division by zero and invalid operators, providing appropriate error messages when necessary.


## Requirements

Arduino board  
LCD display (16x2)  
LiquidCrystal library (included by default in Arduino IDE)
